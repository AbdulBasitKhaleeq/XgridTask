## Features

The goal of this coding challenge is to create a component/module which can be used to show notification messages within a SPA. Those notifications should be used to display information which give the user a feedback, but do not disturb him at the current work. One example would be a chat application, where the notification module displays a slight notification that someone has logged in. The module should be encapsulated, thus it could be shared across multiple projects. The final result should be included into a nice example page, where the features of the notification module can be tested in. 

## Usage
install all libraries
```
npm install
```

run the app on local server

```
ng serve --open
```
